If your server do not loaded the chat script.You basically triggered a chat input box like GTAOL if you pressing T .
But then at that moment you can not typing any other languages but the english.
This script may help you typing a text from other languages into that scalefrom box.
Itâ€™s detect if you opened that scaleform box using IsMultiplayerChatActive(), so this is useless when you never triggered a gamebase chat box.
