If your server do not loaded the chat script.You basically triggered a chat input box like GTAOL if you pressing T .     
But then at that moment you can not typing any other languages but the english.  
This script may help you typing a text from other languages into that scalefrom box.  
It's detect if you opened that scaleform box using IsMultiplayerChatActive(), so this is useless when you never triggered a gamebase chat box.This script would not open a chat box by itself and did not replaced anything.
